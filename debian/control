Description: Minos desktop settings
 This package provides the settings which gives to minos its identity. It's
 intended to be installed in desktop environments.
 .
 Settings are organized in modules which can be enabled/disabled by system
 administrators.
 .
 If a $HOME/.minos/not_override file exists modules will not alter files on
 that user directory.
 .
 Run $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure minos-desktop-settings to enable/disable options
 (enabled all by default).
